This is your first blog post. Use it as a base to create a new one. In Jekyll, all posts are stored inside the `_posts` folder and are written in Markdown. Markdown files have the `.md` or `.markdown` extension. All posts start with a "Front Matter" which defines some meta information about the post, e.g.

```yaml

layout: post
title:  "My first blog post"
date:   2017-02-15 18:40:31 +0100
categories: default
---
```

Inside the Front Matter you have to define a layout, title, and date. In `categories` you can define one or more categories and with the default configuration they will be used inside of the post URL, e.g. `/default/2017/my-first-post`. You can change the URL formar, called `Permalink` inside the `_config.yml` configuration file.
